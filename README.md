# Sorting Algorithms and Big O

This project entails exploring various algorithms to sort elements in a list.

[Sorting Algorithms][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm] is an interesting topic to comprehend, there are various classifications and types but the result(output) must meet two conditions: a monotonic order and permutation of input.

# Aim
At the end, one should be familiar with at least four different sorting algorithms; comprehend the Big O Notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm; how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input and what is a stable sorting algorithm.
